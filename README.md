# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction
Predicting cervical cancer risks using machine learning algorithms.

This project is split into 2 parts:

Part 1: Training the dataset to predict cervical cancer using KNN and SVM.

Part 2: Training the dataset to predict cervical cancer using fuzzy logic and neural networks.

## Objective
The four machine learning algorithms that were used are:

1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Fuzzy Logic
4. Neural Network

The main objective is to predict the likelihood of patients with heart disease based on their medical information and risk factors. 

## Key Features
